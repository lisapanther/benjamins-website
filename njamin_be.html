		<section class="OnTHFtext">
		From August 2012 until September 2013, Benjamin Deboosere and 
		Wouter De Raeve conducted research on the temporary state of Tem- 
		pelhofer Feld on a self-initiated basis as well as within the framework 
		of the artistic research programme Air Berlin Alexanderplatz. Their 
		research aimed to address the following two questions: 'Why is Tempelhofer Feld anno 2013 such an interesting space?' and 'How can 
		Tempelhofer Feld keep its potential?'
		While interviewing a variety of international protagonists on the field 
		of architecture, sociology, urban geography and philosophy, De Raeve 
		and Deboosere critically approached these research questions.  
		The potential of the site was visualized through pictures taken by Deboosere, which convey the feeling present at 
		Tempelhofer Feld during the summer of 2013. These will be collected in the book 'On Tempelhofer Feld' which will be published in the autumn of 2014.
